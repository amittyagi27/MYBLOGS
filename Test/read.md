# Cloud Architecture
 
As a Cloud Architecture team, our main objective is to design comprehensive solutions to ensure seamless migration of workloads to Oracle Cloud. With our extensive skills and experience, we architect solutions for Oracle applications, custom applications, third-party applications, database consolidation, and estate modernization.
 
In FY24, our teamÂ¿s primary focus area continues to be estate modernization. This strategic initiative equips us to effectively handle large-scale customer environments, enabling us to optimize their infrastructure and deliver modern, secure & scalable solutions on OCI.
 
We also actively develop reusable architecture assets that drive best practices not only within Technology Engineering but also across wider Oracle and beyond.
